  <h3>So how did we meet?</h3>
    <p> I met Hugo, formerly known as Marshall, at an adoption event in the Petsmart I was employed at in 2015.
     It was December 5th and I had just gone to pick up my check, not knowing there would be roughly 200 kittens in the building! 
     Needless to say, Hugo won my heart immediatley. He reached his tiny paws up and held my face close to his as he sniffed my nose
     and I scratched his curly belly. I took him home with me and after getting to home him more, decided to name him after my favorte childhood book, "The Invention of Hugo Cabret".
     He has been holding my face the same ever since.

<h2>Hugo's Greatest Acomplishments</h2>

  <p><strong>Indoctrinating "Dog People"</strong></p>
    <li>It's always a proud feline mama moment when Hugo changes someones opinions of cats. In 2019 alone, I had five different friends tell me that Hugo is their favorite cat, he's just so chill! Hugo likes to be a cat scarf, which always suprises people when they meet him.</li>

  <p><strong>Agility</strong></p> 
    <li>After spending four years of life in a studio apartment, moving into a large house helped Hugo gain some confidence. Now he loves to leap from couch to couch, climb his cat tower and chase hair ties all over the house! </li>

  <p><strong>Bat Menace</strong></p>
    <li> Hugo has been known to catch bats in his day, likely leaving them wrapped up in my bedding with holes in their wings - but not dead. </li>
   
  <p><strong>Bath Boi</strong></p>
    <li>Hugo's first bath ever was nothing short of a miracle. It was then I realized, I adopted the greatest cat of all time. I filled up the bath and slowly put him in, he was initially terrified but once fully submerged, he became very calm and swam around curiously. He doesnt love baths, but he allows me to do what needs to be done so he can get out and scurry around like a wet mop on four legs.</li>

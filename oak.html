  <h3>So how did we meet?</h3>
    <p> I met Hugo, formerly known as Marshall, at an adoption event in the Petsmart I was employed at in 2015.
     It was December 5th and I had just gone to pick up my check, not knowing there would be roughly 200 kittens in the building! 
     Needless to say, Hugo won my heart immediatley. He reached his tiny paws up and held my face close to his as he sniffed my nose
     and I scratched his curly belly. I took him home with me and after getting to home him more, decided to name him after my favorte childhood book, "The Invention of Hugo Cabret".
     He has been holding my face the same ever since.
